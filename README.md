# ultimateretro-svg-assets

This repository contains all assets that will be used to create new schemas for ultimateretro. They're inspired by microhouse SVGs, however they're new, much more optimized in terms of shapes and overall size. Also they're made to respect physical dimensions of the elements they're supposed to represent.
